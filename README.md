# Jane-Market-Predictions
Dataset analyzed by Kaggle.com used in R studio
At the height of the resurgence of cryptocurrencies for the finance industry, my partner Jordan and I sought to find patterns that can be possibly exploited or better understood for the stock market.
But because that premise is an entire industry, with crunching numbers, breaking down algorithms, we abandoned that thought. Instead, we found the **Jane Street Market** dataset, which involved observations that outline when a particular stock was bought. Whether we knew what that situation was or what stock was purchased, we will never know.
For trade secrets or possible volatility interference, many of the buying situations were shielded. The information given was whether that stock performed well, if the stock was bought was profitable, and if having multiple conditions increased profit margins.

Though it was challenging to analyze and present, I can confidently say that the stock market is no joke, and you can't predict everything from past information. There are too many variables from social media, politics, and economic situations.

Feel free to message me with any questions about the dataset and other information you need.
